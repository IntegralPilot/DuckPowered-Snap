# DuckPowered-Snap
Our application is called DuckPowered, and the purpose of our app is to automatically underclock Intel CPUs in both Linux Servers and consumer-grade devices.

This underclocking is dynamic, and unique for every core, as the program receives input of the CPUs current usage and uses a smart algorithm to choose just the right clock speed.

Tests have shown that our app chooses a 66% lower clock speed at idle vs Linux Balanced Governor (400MHz (DuckPowered) vs 900MHz (Balanced).

Benchmarking scores (CPU-Z Score, both single and mutli thread) are not affected (give or take 1-10 points).

We don't guarentte any of this however, and this software is distrubted in the hope it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRENTY OF ANY KIND, ETHEIR EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.

Note that this is the Snap version of the app, we have many other solutions avaliable.

All source code is open source, and GPL v3+ licensed.
